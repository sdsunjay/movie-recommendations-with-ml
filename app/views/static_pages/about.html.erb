                <!-- <p>HitchRide was born one Christmas, when founder Sunjay Dhama, a student at Stanford, wanted to get home to his family in the Bay Area. He had no car. The trains were full. The roads, too, were full of people driving home, alone in their car. It occurred to him that he should try and find one of the drivers going his way and offer to share petrol costs in exchange for use of an empty seat. He thought he could do it online, but no such site existed... The adventure had begun!</p> -->

Click movies and tags you like and the system will do the rest â€” in a few clicks, Movix adapts to your preferences and gives you movies worth watching.</p> <h2>How is this different from other recommedation engines</h2> <p>Unlike other services, we don't require registration or long history of films you have watched before. Your taste, mood and preferences change every day and we understand that â€” so every recommendation is completely new! Just click a few movies you would like to watch right now and we will find your movie.</p> <h2>What's inside</h2> <p>We have designed our own custom Neural Network architecture based on LSTM. Itâ€™s built on top of Ternsorflow framework from Google and runs on GPU. Unlike other engines, we have no precalculated recommendations â€” every click is being processed on our servers.</p> <h2>Why we started Movix</h2> <p>Here at <a href="https://deepsystems.io" target="_blank">Deep Systems</a> we are a big fans of artificial intelligence and good cinema. After some evenings looking for a nice movie to watch, we decieded to create a service we would like and use.</p> <p>We hope, you would love Movix too!</p></div>

Try to enter a few movies, that are similar to what you want to watch right know â€” it's the best way to interact with Movix. But you can still save your ratings in <a href="/collections" class="">Collections</a>.</p> <h2>I look for rare films</h2> <p>If you want to see less popular movies, just search for tag "Rare". You can also use tags "Not popular" and "Very popular".</p> <h2>I look for old movies</h2> <p>It is possible to filter recommedations by year of release. Select interesting decades on the right side under label "Years". You can select multiple decades.</p> <h2>The order of movies is important</h2> <p>Our neural network consider movies and tags in input more important, if they are placed closer to the end. If you want to change priority, just drap and drop movie in input.</p> <h2>I don't interested in superheroes movies. Can i drop them?</h2> <p>Yes. If don't want to see some movies, dislike tag that describes film the best. The opposite is possible too â€” like tags if want to see more movies on that topic.</p></div>
