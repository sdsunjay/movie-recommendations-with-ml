                <p>Movie Recommendations with ML is a movie recommendations platform that utilizes cutting edge Machine Learning to make movie recommendations for you based on what your friends have liked and been recommended.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p>Movie Recommendations with ML has been developed as a research project. It is of my own design, but was inspired by <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~eaugusti/pages/about/index.php">Eriq Augustine</a>, who is pursuing his PhD at <a href='https://www.ucsc.edu/'>UC Santa Cruz</a>. I met with him in July and he told me about this new Machine Learning framework called <a href="http://psl.linqs.org">PSL</a> that has been getting astounding results. I read some of <a href="https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/biblio">the publications</a> about it and its really cool what he and the team working on it have done. However, I&#39;m not doing anything groundbreaking in this project. I&#39;m trying to duplicate the results the researchers obtained when using PSL to make recommendations (<a href="https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/node/337">see their publication</a>), except Iâ€™m using my a new set of data. The data, which is essential for the success of this project, is coming from you, the user. Everytime you like or dislike a movie, we utilize your review to make recommendations better for everyone. Thank you so much for making this possible!</p>
              <hr>
                <p>I&#39;ve been working since August 2018 to create a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">rails</a> application users can use to get movie recommendations. Netflix and lots of other companies already provide movie recommendations, but these recommendations will be super accurate. If they aren&#39;t, <a href='#contact'>please let me know</a>. If you experience any trouble accessing <a href="https://movierecommendationswithml.com">https://movierecommendationswithml.com</a>, please let me know. You could have found a bug. ðŸ˜± This site is constantly in development, so I expect there to be some bugs. Once again, if you find something, let me know. I want to make this site better for you and your friends. As of this writing, the recommendations engine is still in development, once users have rated enough movies, the real fun begins of making the recommendations ðŸ˜Š . In the meantime, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/sdsunjay/movie-recommendations-with-ml">the code on Github</a>.</p>

<h2>What is Movie Recommendations with ML</h2>
<p>Movie Recommendations with ML is a movie recommendation service based on <a href="http://psl.linqs.org">Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)</a>, which is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models. In order to get started simply <%= link_to 'Sign Up with Facebook', new_user_registration_path %> and start rating movies. Once you have rated a sufficient number of movies and there are enough users on the site, we will start giving you recommendations.</p>
<h2>How is this different from other recommedation engines</h2>
<p>Unlike other services, we have the most up-to-date selection of movies. We are also constantly adding new ones. While we do require that you register and rate some movies, we know this is an essential part of getting recommendations right! We care deeply about making accurate recommendations. Your taste, mood and preferences change every day and we understand that, we have made it easy to remove your rating from a movie. Simply click the  <%= fa_icon "thumbs-up" %> or the <%= fa_icon "thumbs-down" %> on any movie you have already rated and the rating goes away. It will really help if you have at least one or two friends using the platform, but we understand not everyone can be here, so don't worry if you don't. <%= link_to 'Sign Up with Facebook', new_user_registration_path %> and get started!</p>
<h2>What's inside</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, we are leveraging <a href="http://psl.linqs.org">PSL</a>, which has &quot;produced state-of-the-art results in many areas, such as recommendation systems&quot;. While it will be a few weeks before we can start giving recommendations, we encourage you to continue to rate movies and ask you to share this website with your friends and family.</p>
<h2>Why we started Movie Recommendations with ML</h2>
<p>We are big fans of ML and good movies. We wanted to merge the two. Thus Movie Recommendations with ML was born. With so many movies being produced these days, its impossible to keep up. Why watch movies you don't like, when you can be certain you will see something you enjoy? Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have demonstrated PSL can be used to make social recommendations, lets leverage their research and make highly accurate movie recommendations!</p>
<p>We hope, you would love Movie Recommendations with ML! If you don't, <a href='#contact'>please let me know</a></p>
