                <span class="tittle-line"></span>
                <p>Movie Recommendations with ML is a movie recommendations platform that utilizes cutting edge Machine Learning to make movie recommendations for you based on what your friends have liked and been recommended.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p>Movie Recommendations with ML has been developed as a research project. It is of my own design, but was inspired by <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~eaugusti/pages/about/index.php">Eriq Augustine</a>, who is pursuing his PhD at <a href='https://www.ucsc.edu/'>UC Santa Cruz</a>. I met with him in July and he told me about this new Machine Learning framework called <a href="http://psl.linqs.org">PSL</a> that has been getting astounding results. I read some of <a href="https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/biblio">the publications</a> about it and its really cool what he and the team working on it have done. However, I&#39;m not doing anything groundbreaking in this project. I&#39;m trying to duplicate the results the researchers obtained when using PSL to make recommendations (<a href="https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/node/337">see their publication</a>), except Iâ€™m using my a new set of data. The data, which is essential for the success of this project, is coming from you, the user. Everytime you like or dislike a movie, we utilize your review to make recommendations better for everyone. Thank you so much for making this possible!</p>
              <hr>
                <p>I&#39;ve been working since August 2018 to create a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">rails</a> application users can use to get movie recommendations. Netflix and lots of other companies already provide movie recommendations, but these recommendations will be super accurate. If they aren&#39;t, <a href='#contact'>please let me know</a>. If you experience any trouble accessing <a href="https://movierecommendationswithml.com">https://movierecommendationswithml.com</a>, please let me know. You could have found a bug. ðŸ˜± This site is constantly in development, so I expect there to be some bugs. Once again, if you find something, let me know. I want to make this site better for you and your friends. As of this writing, the recommendations engine is still in development, once users have rated enough movies, the real fun begins of making the recommendations ðŸ˜Š . In the meantime, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/sdsunjay/movie-recommendations-with-ml">the code on Github</a>.</p>

<h2>What is Movix</h2>
<p>Movix is a movie recommendation service based on artificial intelligence and Deep Learning. Click movies and tags         you like and the system will do the rest â€” in a few clicks, Movix adapts to your preferences and gives you movies worth watching.</p>
<h2>How is this           different from other recommedation engines</h2>
<p>Unlike other services, we don't require registration or long history of films you have watched before.       Your taste, mood and preferences change every day and we understand that â€” so every recommendation is completely new! Just click a few movies you would         like to watch right now and we will find your movie.</p>
<h2>What's inside</h2>
<p>We have designed our own custom Neural Network architecture based on         LSTM. Itâ€™s built on top of Ternsorflow framework from Google and runs on GPU. Unlike other engines, we have no precalculated recommendations â€” every click      is being processed on our servers.</p>
<h2>Why we started Movix</h2>
<p>Here at <a href="https://deepsystems.io" target="_blank">Deep Systems</a> we are a      big fans of artificial intelligence and good cinema. After some evenings looking for a nice movie to watch, we decieded to create a service we would like       and use.</p>
<p>We hope, you would love Movix too!</p>

  <h2>I want to upload my ratings for every movie i have watched</h2>
  <p>When we designed Movix, we tried to make our service give awesome recommedations even if you don't rate tons of movies. Try to enter a few movies, that      are similar to what you want to watch right know â€”      it's the best way to interact with Movix. But you can still save your ratings in <a href="/collections"      class="">Collections</a>.</p>
  <h2>I look for rare films</h2>
  <p>If you want to see less popular movies, just search for tag "Rare". You can also use tags       "Not popular" and "Very popular".</p>
  <h2>I look for old movies</h2>
  <p>It is possible to filter recommedations by year of release. Select interesting          decades on the right side under label "Years". You can select multiple decades.</p>
  <h2>The order of movies is important</h2>
  <p>Our neural network             consider movies and tags in input more important, if they are placed closer to the end. If you want to change priority, just drap and drop movie in input.      </p>
  <h2>I don't interested in superheroes movies. Can i drop them?</h2>
  <p>Yes. If don't want to see some movies, dislike tag that describes film the          best. The opposite is possible too â€” like tags if want to see more movies on that topic.</p>
